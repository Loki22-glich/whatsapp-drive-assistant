# üì± WhatsApp Drive Assistant ‚Äì Internship Task (Q2)

This project is a WhatsApp-based Drive Assistant built using **n8n.io**, **Twilio**, and **low-code automation**.

It is part of my internship task submission ‚Äì **Question 2**, where I had to build an automated assistant that can receive WhatsApp commands like `LIST`, `DELETE`, `MOVE`, etc., and send proper responses.

## üõ† Tech Stack

- [n8n.io](https://n8n.io) ‚Äì Automation platform (free cloud)
- Twilio WhatsApp Sandbox ‚Äì For sending & receiving messages
- JavaScript ‚Äì Used inside the n8n Function node

---

## üí¨ How it Works

1. A **Webhook** receives the message sent via WhatsApp.
2. A **Function node** parses the message into:
   - `command` (LIST / DELETE / MOVE / SUMMARY)
   - `target` (like a file name or folder)
3. A **Switch node** routes the command
4. A **Set node** builds the reply message
5. A **Twilio node** sends the response to WhatsApp

LIST /ProjectX
DELETE /file.txt
MOVE /file.txt /Archive
SUMMARY /Budget2024

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Twilio sandbox was used for this demo
- File actions are simulated (no real Drive API used)
- Fully modular and extendable to real cloud storage
